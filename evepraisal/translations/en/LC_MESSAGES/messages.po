"        <h4>What is this?</h4>        <p>This is a tool for Eve Online "
"aimed at being able to quickly price check items. </p>        <h4>Why "
"would I use this?</h4>        <p>You scan a drake full of original "
"blueprints that you weren't able to quickly see because you sorting "
"through the tabacco, spirits, exotic dancers, T1 planetary comodaties, "
"livestock, garbage, scrap metal, and other random junk you're likely to "
"find in the cargo hold. This tool will allow you to quickly see what's "
"valuable and a rough estimate of how valueable everything is so the few "
"seconds that you have to decide to commit won't be wasted messing messing"
" around with eve's UI. This tool also happens to be pretty decent at "
"doing quick price checks. It currently is known to work with cargo scan "
"results and EFT-formatted blocks.</p>        <h4>How are prices "
"calculated?</h5>        <p>Prices are pulled from <a href=\"http://eve-"
"central.com/\">Eve-Central.com</a> and (as a backup) <a href=\"http"
"://eve-marketdata.com/\">Eve-Marketdata.com</a>. The pricing is limited "
"to the following regions: Forge, Metropolis, Heimatar, Sinq Laison "
"region, Domain. This is because each of these regions has a large market "
"hub. Capital ship prices are set by the sum of their component parts.</p>"
"        <h4>Caveats/Known Issues</h4>        <ul>          <li>There's no"
" reliable way to get prices of blueprint copies (BPCs). Due to this, I "
"don't even try to guess a price for them.</li>        </ul>        "
"<h4>Problems/More Questions?</h4>        <p>Feel free to send me an in-"
